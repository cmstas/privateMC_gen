#   This script is used by McM when it performs automatic   #
#  validation in HTCondor or submits requests to computing  #
#                                                           #
#      !!! THIS FILE IS NOT MEANT TO BE RUN BY YOU !!!      #
# If you want to run validation script yourself you need to #
#     get a "Get test" script which can be retrieved by     #
#  clicking a button next to one you just clicked. It will  #
# say "Get test command" when you hover your mouse over it  #
#      If you try to run this, you will have a bad time     #

# Maximum validation duration: 28800s
# Margin for validation duration: 30%
# Validation duration with margin: 28800 * (1 - 0.30) = 20160s
# Time per event for each sequence: 1.4475s
# Threads for each sequence: 4
# Time per event for single thread for each sequence: 4 * 1.4475s = 5.7900s
# Which adds up to 5.7900s per event
# Single core events that fit in validation duration: 20160s / 5.7900s = 3481
# Produced events limit in McM is 10000
# According to 1.0000 efficiency, validation should run 10000 / 1.0000 = 10000 events to reach the limit of 10000
# Take the minimum of 3481 and 10000, but more than 0 -> 3481
# It is estimated that this validation will produce: 3481 * 1.0000 = 3481 events
